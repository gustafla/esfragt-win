Esfragt <https://github.com/luutifa/esfragt> port for Windows, uses GLFW and GLEW, configure those manually when building.  
Meant for Visual C++ 2010 (express), but probably pretty easy to build with anything else if you know your stuff.  
For an easy prebuilt package, just download the x86 zip from the root.

Again, no proper licensing but I don't care what you do with the sources.  

Check --help (or text.cpp) for additional help.  
Generally this works fine from drag&drop or file association.
